# 🎬 End-to-End Data Engineering Pipeline for Movie Recommendation

This project implements a fully automated **ELT data engineering pipeline** for movie recommendation analytics using:

- **Snowflake** – Cloud Data Warehouse  
- **Apache Airflow** – Workflow Orchestration  
- **dbt (Data Build Tool)** – In-warehouse Transformations  
- **Preset / Apache Superset** – BI Dashboarding  
- **TMDB 10,000 Movies Dataset (CSV)** – Primary Static Source  
- **TMDB API Enrichment** – Dynamic Metadata (genres, similar movies, popularity, etc.)

The pipeline loads raw movie data, enriches it using the TMDB API, processes it through dbt models, and visualizes results in a Preset dashboard designed for movie recommendation insights.

## 🔍 **Project Overview**

This pipeline answers:  
**“Given any movie, what are the most similar films in terms of genre, popularity, rating, and release characteristics?”**

The workflow supports:

- Data ingestion from CSV  
- API-driven data enrichment  
- Snowflake transformation using dbt  
- Airflow DAG automation  
- Analytical dashboard for recommendations
